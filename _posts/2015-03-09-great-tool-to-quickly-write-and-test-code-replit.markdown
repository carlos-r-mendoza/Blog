When I quickly want to write and test code, I often use <strong><a title="repl.it" href="http://repl.it/" target="_blank">repl.it</a></strong>, which is an online environment where user input (code) is evaluated. This great tool allows code to be written and evaluated on one screen, where the left-hand side is designated for code input and the right-hand side returns the results of the code. It supports JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, and many more programming languages!

This tool saves me a lot of time, since I don't have to open a text editor or <a title="Integrated Development Environment" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" target="_blank">IDE</a> every time I want to write, test, and explore certain code blocks.
