I will be adding regularly to this terms list. My goal is to add one word a day.

**Constant** - is an [identifier](#identifiers) with a value that cannot be altered while a program executes. This is opposite to the value of a variable, which can be altered during program execution.  

**Data Validation** - the process of checking for correctness, meaningfulness, and security of data to be inputted to the system to ensure a program operates with clean, correct, and useful data. Validation can be implemented by adding logic to an application or through a data dictionary.
  
**Delegation** - an object relying on another object to provide a specific set of functionalities. This feature is often found in prototype-based languages such as JavaScript (prototypes).  

**Enumeration Type** (also called enumeration or enum) - a data type consisting of a set of [identifier](#identifiers) that behave as constants in a language.  

<a name="identifiers"></a>**ETL (Extract, Transform, Loading)** - a process of database usage that does the following:

* **Extracts** - process of reading data from a database.
* **Transforms** - process of converting data to a format that is storable in the database or good for querying.
* **Loads** - process of writing the data into the database.
	  
**Identifiers** - a name given to a value that serves as a label. For instance, in JavaScript, variable and function names serve as identifiers.
  
**Immutable Object** - an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.

**Meta-Data** - data about data.
  
**Mixin** - a class in object-oriented programming that contains a combination of methods from other classes.
  
**Patch** - a piece of software to fix or improve a program or its supporting data.
  
**Polyfill** - code (or plugin) that can be added to a web application that allows functionality expected to work natively on a browser but that might not have yet been added to the browser. Polyfills allow for more consistency across browser APIs.
