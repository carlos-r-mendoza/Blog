What is a Sprint?
The Sprint is the basic unit of work for a Scrum team, and it may be the feature of Scrum that most differentiates it from other Agile models. A sprint is a single iteration carried out by a team.

A team may complete several sprints on its way to preparing a release of software. A sprint starts with a team commiting to working be done and ends with a demonstration of potentially shippable product. Most of the work to develop and test a feature happens within a sprint.

A team at the beginning of a sprint and the members make estimates on the effort of each item. Reach consesus on how many items they can commit to. 

A sprint should no be longer than a month. It is sometimes refer to as a time box. 2-3 week cycles are common. Each sprint has the same duration that allows team to form a rythm. A new sprint begins immediately after a sprint finishes. Provides predicatble pattern. 

Sprint Product: The outcome of a sprint is “potentially shippable product,” or working software that has the potential to be shipped to the customer.
Time Box: Once begun, the team is committed to spending exactly the allotted time on the sprint.
Cadence: When team has a consistent sprint length, they develop a rhythm or cadence to their work.

Shippable product - we value working software over comprehensive documentation. Software design, built, and tested. Team has agreed definition of working software.


The Scrum methodology is an agile model consisting of a well-defined framework for carrying out software development in teams. This course, teaches the “who,” “what,” “when,” “where,” and “why” of Scrum.

Scrum is a framework for working as a team in a series of iterations.

The term scrum was coined based on an analogy based on the game of rugby football, where members of the team pass the ball back and forth to one anthoer while trying to advance their position in the field. This is similar to software development becauase a team has a body of work they agreed to and pass pieces back and forth with the goal of completing it.


A scrum team consists of 3 roles:
1. Product Owner - serves as the voice of the customer and maintains the product backlog. Responsible for figuring out what the team should work on and how long. They spend a lot of time talking to the other people in the organization and to customers. 

The Product Owner is sometimes referred to as the “voice of the customer,” though the role entails more than that. The Product Owner is responsible for determining what the team might work on and ordering the items so that the highest-priority items are done first.

No one but the prodcut owner has the authority to ask the dev team to work on a particular item/feature/change. Responsible for vision and roadmap of product. Should be able to clearly communicate where the product is going and what major things lie ahead for the product roadmap.

Product backlog is a to list. Product owner organized backlog by what should be on there and priority. User story is a speacial form of a product backlog written from the user's view point. User story crafted by prodcut owner like Is, what they need an why they need it. They need to be avaialbe to devs during a sprint for more info or review. Needs to be collaboration.

Prioritize backlog is more iportant role of product owner.

2. Scrum Master - responsible for making sure the work of team goes smoothly by facilitating scrum and removing impediments to the team's progress. Anything that gets in the way.

The Scrum Master removes impediments, or blockers, allowing the Scrum team to proceed with their work smoothly and effectively.

Scrum master handles logistics, such as scheduling scrum events and handling scrum tools. A servent leader. Identifies anything that can get in the way and tries to solve it. 

Team success is the scrum master's priority.

they fight mission creep, preventing team distracted from sprint goals. 

A faciliator that sometimes needs to be firm that they should not look outside the sprint and focus on finishing sprint tasks.

Prodcut Owner and scrum master have a healthy balance. Sometimes at odd with one another. The balance of these two roles serves the scrum team well.


3. Development Team Members - Software engineers write and test codes, they are responsible for self-assigining tasks and chekcing their work on each item against and items conditions of acceptance.

Share a definition of done and a set of standard a team agrees before they accept a backlog item as finished.

Cross functional, flexible in the kind of work that they can do to contribute to the team. If the tasks needed in a different area, they can come in and help event if it will take a longer. Team goal/sprint goal is more important than optimiztion. Can look at scrum master if doubt.  




Stakeholder is someone outside the Scrum team who has a say in what the product should be, such as a manager, client, or customer

Product Owner is the “voice of the customer” and is responsible for developing, maintaining, and prioritizing the items in the product backlog.
Scrum Master is responsible for making sure the work of the team goes smoothly by facilitating Scrum and removing impediments.
Development Team Members are the members of the team who write and test code

User Story: A product backlog item constructed to describe the value to the user. User stories define who the user is, what they need, and why they need it.


We use the term stakeholder to identify people not in scrum team who has a say in what the product should be (other people in the organization or customer). The product must consult stakeholders.
