Object Oriented Programming

Mixin - in object-oriented programming languages, a mixin is a class that contains a combination of methods from other classes.

ETL (Extract, Transform, Loading)
Extract - process of reading data from a database
Transform - process of converting the extracted from its previous form into the form it needs to be in so that it can be placed in another database. 
Load - process of writing the data into the target base.

Patch - is a piece of software designed to update a computer program or its supporting data, to fix or improve it. 

Data Validation - the process of ensuring a program operates on clean, correct and useful data. It uses routines, often called "validation rules" "validation constraints" or "check routines", that check for correctness, meaningfulness, and security of data that are input to the system. The rules may be implemented through the automated facilities of a data dictionary, or by the inclusion of explicit application program validation logic.

Immutable Object - is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is creted.

Delegation - in JavaScript, if a property called on an Object does not exist directly on the Object, then it goes to the Object's prototype until finally reaching Object.prototype. 

Reflection - the ability of a computer program to examine (see introspection) and modify its own structure and behavior.

Instropection -  the ability of a program to examine the type of properties of an object at runtime. Introspection should not be confused with reflection, which goes a step further and is the ability for a program to manipulate the values, meta-data, properties, and/or functions of an object at runtime. 

Enumeration - is a complete, ordered listing of all the items in a collection.

Polyfill - a browser fallback, made in JavaScript, that allows functionality you expect to work on modern browsers to work in older browsers.

Some code that allows you to have some sepceifct functionality that you expect in current or "modern" browsers to also work in other browsers that do not have the support for that functionality built in.(http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/html5/html5-polyfill/)

is downloadable code which provides facilities that are not built into a web browser. It implements technology that a developer expects the browser to provide natively, providing a more uniform API landscape. For example, many features of HTML5 are not supported by versions of Internet Explorer older than version 8 or 9, but can be used by web pages if those pages install a polyfill.

Encoding - 
1. the process of putting a sequence of characters into a special format for transmission or storage purposes.
2. used to reference the process of analog-to-digital conversion, and can be used in the context of any type of data such as text, images, audio, video, or multimedia.
Meta-Data - data about data.
































Identifiers - a name given to a value that serves as a label. For instance, in JavaScript, variable and function names serve as identifiers.



Constant - is an identifier with a value that cannot be altered while a program executes. This is opposite to the value of a variable, which can be altered during program execution.

Enumeration Type (also called enumeration or enum) - a data type consisting of a set of identifiers that behave as constants in a language.
