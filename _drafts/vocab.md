Upserting

ETL (Extract, Transform, Loading)
Extract - process of reading data from a database
Transform - process of converting the extracted from its previous form into the form it needs to be in so that it can be placed in another database. 
Load - process of writing the data into the target base.

Patch - is a piece of software designed to update a computer program or its supporting data, to fix or improve it. 

Immutable Object - is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is creted.

Delegation - in JavaScript, if a property called on an Object does not exist directly on the Object, then it goes to the Object's prototype until finally reaching Object.prototype. 

Reflection - the ability of a computer program to examine (see introspection) and modify its own structure and behavior.

Instropection -  the ability of a program to examine the type of properties of an object at runtime. Introspection should not be confused with reflection, which goes a step further and is the ability for a program to manipulate the values, meta-data, properties, and/or functions of an object at runtime. 

Enumeration - is a complete, ordered listing of all the items in a collection.

Recursion - 
Invocations
Expression

Meta-Data - data about data.
