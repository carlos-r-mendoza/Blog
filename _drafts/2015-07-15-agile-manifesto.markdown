In 2001, 17 software developer, less time and resources to develop software, created the agile manifesto

The Agile Manifesto encourages teams to think about how to break down the silos that separate people working on a project, giving people formal roles and responsibilities and providing expectations for collaboration.

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools (people on project should have a clear understanding of their role, and providing expectation for collaboration)
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation (values working software over specs)
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation (clients move into a collaborative role rather than being consulted at the beginning and end of a project)
4. Responding to change over following a plan (more important to create the right product thatn sticking to a plan, adding value to the customer)


What can agile do for me?
1. many teams are adopting agile practices, and understanding agile development will be important in working iwth ohters, and improve your eligiglity for job opening.
2. There are very few software developrs that work on their own.
3. even being a team of one, this will help to prioriitze your work and to hear the voice of the customer


Working software is the primary measurement of progress in agile.


treehouse user comment: Waterfall is excellent for time tested repeatable projects. Its still actively being used in construction projects and turnkey projects where the process is highly predictable due to experience. Agile on the other hand is excellent for software development where a lot of unknowns are usually in place when the project begins, requirements change, competition steps up the game and you will always need an agile methodology to respond. like someone said above, look at it ike some sort of evolutionary trend.
