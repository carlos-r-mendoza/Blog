Waterfall Model: A model for software development that follows a sequential and irreversible series of steps, like water flowing downstream.

A time-honored tradition in software development is to use a consistent sequence of stages to design, build, and test software. This sequential model is often called, “waterfall” because, like water flowing downstream, it is characterized by a process of irreversible flow from stage to stage from start to finish.

At each step in the waterfall model, a specialize group of people or a department, is tasked with completing the work in that stage, then they handed off to the next group.

There is formal documentation handed from one group to the next.

There are a few problems with the waterfall model. The handoff a project from one group to the next is often described as the childhood game of waterfall. The interpretation of everyone involved can be different and this can result in the client not receiving the product desired.

There is not a lot of opportunity to respond to chaning priorities or outside influences.

Problems
1. Time and resources wasted in handoff
2. Product does not fit original intent 
3. Difficult to respond to change

Tip: during handoffs, what can be done to increase collaboration so that everyone involved in the project can have a better understanding.
