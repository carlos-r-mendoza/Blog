In Java, you can think of variables as containers that you can name and store data in. 

Variables allow you to display repeated data in your program and to easily change the data in one location.

In Java, the first word is the data type of the variable. The second word is the name of the variable. Use letters and numbers, don't start with a number, and do not use special characters (except _). 

To make a string, put a quotation around the string.

The equal puts the data into the variable. 

The semicolon is like a period in sentences. Each statement and command needs to end with a semicolon.
