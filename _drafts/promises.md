What is a promise?
The core idea behind promises is that a promise represents the result of an asynchronous operation. A promise is in one of three different states:

pending - The initial state of a promise.
fulfilled - The state of a promise representing a successful operation.
rejected - The state of a promise representing a failed operation.
Once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, it is immutable (i.e. it can never change again).
